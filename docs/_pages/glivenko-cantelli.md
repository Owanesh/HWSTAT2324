### 3.2 Independence and Identically Distributed Random Variables

At the heart of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem lie two fundamental concepts: independence and identically distributed random variables. Independence signifies the lack of relationship between the outcomes of different random variables, emphasizing the absence of influence that one variable exerts on another. Identically distributed random variables ensure that each element of the sequence follows the same probability distribution, allowing for a consistent and uniform analysis of convergence.

The assumption of independence and identical distribution is pivotal in the applicability of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem. It reflects the idealized conditions under which the theorem holds true, providing a clear pathway for understanding the convergence behavior of the empirical distribution function. The theoretical elegance of the theorem hinges on these assumptions, and a nuanced exploration of their implications enriches our understanding of the theoretical framework.

### 3.3 Statement of Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem

The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, in its simplicity, encapsulates a profound insight into the convergence behavior of the empirical distribution function. Formally stated, the theorem declares that, under the assumptions of independence and identical distribution, the empirical distribution function converges to the true distribution function almost surely. This convergence is uniform, meaning that it holds across the entire range of the distribution.

Mathematically, let $F_n$ represent the empirical distribution function based on a sample of size $n$, and let $F$ represent the true distribution function. The theorem asserts that $\sup |F_n(x) - F(x)| \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, where $\sup$ denotes the supremum, capturing the maximum discrepancy between the empirical and true distribution functions.

Understanding the formal statement of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem sets the stage for its exploration and application. This statement encapsulates the essence of the theorem, highlighting the uniform convergence that distinguishes it from other convergence theorems.

### 3.4 Assumptions and Implications

The power of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem arises from its assumptions, and a critical examination of these assumptions illuminates the contexts in which the theorem is applicable. The assumption of independence ensures that the observed outcomes are not influenced by one another, a condition that aligns with the notion of random sampling. Simultaneously, the assumption of identical distribution emphasizes the consistency in the underlying probability model, allowing for a coherent analysis of convergence.

Implications of these assumptions resonate throughout the realm of statistical inference. When these conditions are met, the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem provides a robust tool for understanding how empirical estimates converge to their theoretical counterparts. However, it is crucial to recognize the limitations imposed by these assumptions. Real-world data may deviate from the idealized conditions, and a thoughtful exploration of these assumptions guides researchers in assessing the applicability of the theorem to their specific scenarios.

As we navigate through the assumptions and implications, we gain a deeper appreciation for the theoretical framework that underlies the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem. This critical examination sets the stage for the subsequent sections, where we explore extensions, variations, and practical applications of this fundamental convergence theorem.

np.random.seed(42)  # Setting seed for reproducibility
sample_size = 1000
data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=sample_size)

# True distribution function (in this case, the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution)
true_distribution = lambda x: (1 + np.math.erf(x / np.sqrt(2))) / 2

# Empirical distribution function
empirical_dist = empirical_distribution(data)

# Plotting
x_values = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
plt.plot(x_values, true_distribution(x_values), label='True Distribution')
plt.plot(x_values, [empirical_dist(x) for x in x_values], label='Empirical Distribution (n=1000)')
