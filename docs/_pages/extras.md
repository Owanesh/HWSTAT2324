## Game of Life
The Game of Life, devised by mathematician John Conway, is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a population based on simple rules. Comprising a grid of cells, each cell follows rules of birth, survival, and death, creating mesmerizing patterns. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life serves as a captivating example of emergent complexity in a dynamic system.
