**Functional Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** The Functional Central Limit Theorem is an extension of the classical Central Limit Theorem to functional spaces. It deals with the convergence in distribution of functionals of independent and identically distributed random variables. In simpler terms, it explains how the distribution of certain functions of random variables tends to a Gaussian distribution as the sample size increases. This theorem is fundamental in various statistical and mathematical analyses, providing insights into the behavior of functionals derived from random processes.

**Donsker's Invariance Principle:** Donsker's Invariance Principle is a key result related to the Functional CLT. It asserts that under certain conditions, the distributional limit in the Functional CLT is a Brownian motion. In other words, as the sample size grows, the distribution of a standardized and centered version of the empirical process converges to that of a Brownian motion. Donsker's Invariance Principle has broad applications in probability theory, statistics, and functional analysis.

**Proof and Mathematical Formulation:** The proof of the Functional CLT and Donsker's Invariance Principle involves advanced mathematical concepts from probability theory and functional analysis. One of the key formulas associated with the Functional CLT is:

$\sqrt{n} \left( F_n - F \right) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{G} $

Here, $F_n$ is the empirical distribution function based on the sample, $F$ is the limiting distribution function, $n$ is the sample size, and $\mathcal{G}$ represents a Gaussian process. Donsker's Invariance Principle extends this concept to functional spaces, demonstrating the convergence to a Brownian motion.

**Simulations and Practical Applications:** Simulations play a crucial role in illustrating the principles of the Functional CLT and Donsker's Invariance Principle. By generating random samples and applying the theorems, one can visually observe how the distribution of certain functionals evolves towards a Gaussian distribution or a Brownian motion. These simulations provide a practical and intuitive understanding of these complex mathematical concepts, aiding researchers and practitioners in applying these theorems to real-world scenarios.

To explain it briefly, the Functional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Donsker's Invariance Principle are concepts in probability theory and functional analysis. The Functional CLT deals with how certain functions of random variables approach a Gaussian distribution as the sample size increases. Donsker's Invariance Principle extends this idea, stating that the distributional limit in the Functional CLT is a Brownian motion under specific conditions. Simulations are often employed to visually understand these complex principles, providing practical insights into their applications in real-world scenarios.
