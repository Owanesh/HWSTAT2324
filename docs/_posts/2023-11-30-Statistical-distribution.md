### Continuous Distributions:

In continuous distributions, the random variable can take any value within a specified range. Probability density functions (PDFs) are used to describe the likelihood of different values. Examples of continuous distributions include:

**Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):**
    Description: Symmetric bell-shaped curve.
    Real-world example: Heights of individuals in a population.

**Exponential Distribution:**
    Description: Models the time between events in a process.
    Real-world example: Time between arrivals of customers at a service point.

**Uniform Distribution:**
    Description: All values in a range are equally likely.
    Real-world example: Randomly selecting a point within a given area.

### Discrete Distributions:

In discrete distributions, the random variable can only take specific, separate values. Probability mass functions (PMFs) are used to describe the likelihood of each possible value. Examples include:

- **Binomial Distribution:**
    Description: Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
    Real-world example: Coin flips, where success is getting heads.

- **Poisson Distribution:**
    Description: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
    Real-world example: Number of phone calls at a call center in an hour.

### Properties of Distributions:

- Mean (Expected Value): The average value of a random variable.
- Variance: A measure of the spread or dispersion of a distribution.
- Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance; it indicates the average deviation from the mean.
- Skewness: A measure of the asymmetry of a distribution.
- Kurtosis: Measures the "tailedness" of a distribution.


### Examples:
Imagine simulating the distribution of dice rolls:

- **Discrete Simulation:**
    Roll a fair six-sided die repeatedly.
    Record the frequency of each outcome.
    The simulation should approximate a uniform distribution.

-   **Continuous Simulation:**
    Simulate the height distribution of a population.
    Use a random number generator based on a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation.
    Observe the simulated heights.
