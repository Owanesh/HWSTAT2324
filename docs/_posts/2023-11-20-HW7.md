>First of all realize that the general scheme that you used so far (random walk and also Poisson process, etc.), can, more in general, be used for any stochastic differential equations SDE (see, for instance, Euler–Maruyama method https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method).
>
>In other words, with minor additions to your program you can now generalize this tool to simulate almost any stochastic differential equations of interest for many applications
>
>Create a web only version where you allow the user to explore (selectable by user) any useful stochastic process.
