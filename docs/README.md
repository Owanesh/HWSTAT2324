This Blog is dedicated to storing exercises assigned by our professor. The primary purpose of this Blog is to provide a centralized location for student submit their assignments. It is designed to help students keep track of both theoretical and coding exercises.
#### Notice
Important Reminder: All the code associated with these posts is available on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Owanesh/HWSTAT2324/). In this blog post, we’ll primarily showcase the ‘main’ part of the assignment or exercise. For more detailed information, comprehensive explanations, and additional insights, we encourage you to refer to the README in the repository, which contains a thorough description of each exercise. The [README](https://github.com/Owanesh/HWSTAT2324/blob/main/source/README.md) in the source code on GitHub also provides valuable context and documentation for your convenience. This dual-resource approach ensures you have access to both the practical code implementation and the in-depth understanding of each concept.
