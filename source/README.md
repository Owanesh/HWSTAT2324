# Sourcecode for Statistics Homework.

In this section of the repository, folders are organized by code, and within each folder, you can find various homework assignments labeled as `HWn` where `n` is a progressive number corresponding to each homework.

JavaScript code, when not enclosed within a folder, is always included directly within the HTML file to ensure seamless execution.

## Homework History

| Homework Number | JS | C# | Theory| Description |
| --------------- | ---| -- | ----- |-|
| HW1             | [hw1.html](JavaScript/HW1.html) |[C#/hw1](CSharp/HW1) | [HW1](../theory/hw1.md) |**Theory (intro)**<br>- What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.<br>- Describe the concepts of Population, Sample Attribute, Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset.<br>- Briefly describe the main sampling methods<br>- Briefly describe the main experiment designs<br>**Applications (intro)**<br>- Write a program in C# or VB.NET that creates a window containing a single line, point, circle, rectangle<br>- Write a program in JavaScript or TypeScript that creates a window containing a single line, point, circle, rectangle. |
| HW2.1  |[HW2.1](JavaScript/HW2/one.html) | still working | | Choose 3 variables from our surveys:<br>- one Qualitative<br>- one Quantitative discrete<br>- one Quantitative continuous (use class intervals in this case, obviously)<br>create the most efficient algorithms to compute the frequency (absolute/relative/percentage) distribution of:<br>- the 3 variables<br>- the joint distribution of 2 variables (use a general logic, where variables could be any number). 
| HW2.2  |[HW2.2](JavaScript/HW2/two.md) | [CSharp/HW2.2](CSharp/HW2.2/MainPage.xaml.cs)|| For the following most important data structures (or others that you may want to suggest) find out how to:<br>- loop (break/continue)<br>- add/remove/get/set/check the existence of key/value<br>**data structures**:<br>array, list, dictionary, sorted list, hashset, sortedset, queue, stack, linkedlist (or any other structure you think to be useful|
| HW2.3  | [HW2.3](JavaScript/HW2/three.html)  | [CSharp/HW2.3](CSharp/HW2.3/MainPage.xaml.cs) | | Generate N uniform random variates in [0,1) and determine the distribution into class intervals [i/k, (i+1)/k), i = 0,..., k-1. Play with N and k values and draw some conclusion on the "shape" of the distribution. |
