# Sourcecode for Statistics Homework.

In this section of the repository, folders are organized by code, and within each folder, you can find various homework assignments labeled as `HWn` where `n` is a progressive number corresponding to each homework.

JavaScript code, when not enclosed within a folder, is always included directly within the HTML file to ensure seamless execution.
