# HWSTAT2324
Homework for Statistic class on year 23/24
## Objective

This repository is dedicated to storing exercises assigned by our professor. The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for student submit their assignments. It is designed to help students keep track of both theoretical and coding exercises.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

### 1. `theory`

This folder contains exercises that are primarily theoretical in nature. These exercises may require written explanations, diagrams, or other non-code-based responses.

### 2. `source`

The `source` folder is dedicated to exercises that require coding solutions. These exercises typically involve writing code in C# and JavaScript to solve specific problems or implement certain functionalities.

#### 1. `c#`

The `c#` folder contains exercises where you are required to write code in C#. It is recommended to use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio for working on C# exercises in this folder. Inside the `c#` folder, you find separate directories for each exercise, each containing the C# source code (.cs) files and any related assets.

#### 2. `javascript`

The `javascript` folder is intended for exercises that require coding solutions in JavaScript. In this folder, you'll find HTML files along with JavaScript code that can be executed directly in a web browser. These exercises are designed to be run in a web browser without the need for a specialized IDE.


_By structuring the `source` folder in this way, you can easily distinguish between C# and JavaScript exercises, making it convenient for both me and the professor to work with different programming languages for the assignments._

## System and Platform Information

Code within this repository is written also in C#. It's important to note that all builds and screenshots included in this repository were created and captured on a macOS system using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI). 

### Environment Details for C#

- **Operating System:** macOS
- **Development Framework:** .NET MAUI
- **Programming Language:** C#
